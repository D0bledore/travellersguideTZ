                    <h2>Facts about Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse culture, rich history, and natural
                        beauty. The country gained independence from Britain in 1961. The capital city is Dodoma, while
                        Dar es Salaam remains the largest city and main economic hub. The official languages are Swahili
                        and English, and the currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).</p>
                    <p>Tanzania's vibrant and youthful population stands at 67,438,106 in 2023, experiencing a robust
                        annual growth rate of 2.96% and holding a significant global presence at 0.84%, ranking 22nd in
                        the world. The nationâ€™s vitality is reflected in its remarkably young median age of 17 years and
                        a high Total Fertility Rate of 4.6 live births per woman, symbolizing a society full of life and
                        potential. Life expectancy brings a mix of hope and challenge, with an average of 67.6 years,
                        where women live slightly longer at 69.8 years compared to 65.5 years for men. The
                        heart-wrenching infant mortality rate is 29.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the mortality
                        rate for children under five is 39.7 per 1,000, highlighting ongoing healthcare struggles.
                        Urbanization is steadily advancing, with 38% of the population living in cities, and Dar es
                        Salaam thrives as the bustling heart of Tanzania, home to 2,698,652 people.</p>

                    <h2>History of Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania's history is deeply rooted in ancient human activity, highlighted by the discovery of
                        the Paranthropus boisei skull by Mary Leakey at Olduvai Gorge in 1959, dating back to between
                        2.3 and 1.2 million years ago. Before the 19th century, most historical records focus on the
                        coastal areas, although the interior holds significant prehistoric sites like Olduvai. The
                        coastal regions saw major waves of in-migration and trade from Greece, Rome, Phoenicia, Arabia,
                        Persia, and India starting as early as the 5th century BCE. These early trading interactions led
                        to the establishment of numerous Asian and Arab settlements along the coast and into the
                        interior, fostering relatively friendly relations between Arabs and African neighbors. The
                        arrival of the Portuguese in the late 15th century challenged Arab dominance, but their
                        influence waned by the early 18th century due to alliances between coastal Arabs and the ruler
                        of Muscat.</p>

                        <figcaption>The Olduvai Gorge or Oldupai Gorge in Tanzania is one of the most important
                            paleoanthropological localities in the world; the many sites exposed by the gorge have
                            proven
                            invaluable in furthering understanding of early human evolution.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The late 18th century saw renewed interest in the region from the French, who revived the slave
                        trade from Kilwa, prompting the sultan of Muscat to appoint a new Omani governor there. This
                        period marked a significant increase in Arab trading activities, particularly in slaves and
                        ivory, with Arab traders penetrating deeper into the interior by the 19th century. Important
                        trading centers like Tabora and Ujiji emerged, though they faced resistance from African leaders
                        like Mirambo, who disrupted trade routes in the 1860s and '70s.</p>
                    <p>European interest in Tanganyika grew in the 19th century with missionaries such as Johann Ludwig
                        Krapf and Johannes Rebmann reaching Kilimanjaro in the late 1840s. Their reports stimulated
                        British explorers Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke to journey from Bagamoyo to Lake
                        Tanganyika in 1857-58, with Speke also exploring Lake Victoria. David Livingstone's expedition
                        in 1866 aimed to expose the slave trade's horrors and promote legitimate commerce, leading to
                        further explorations by H.M. Stanley and V.L. Cameron. These European explorations, driven by a
                        mix of geographic curiosity and humanitarian concerns, significantly influenced the region,
                        attracting more missionary societies and intertwining Tanzania's history with broader global
                        narratives.</p>

                    <p>Bagamoyo, a historic town in Tanzania, played a pivotal role in the East African slave trade
                        during the 18th and 19th centuries. The town's coral buildings, characteristic of Swahili
                        construction, served as a gathering point where slaves from the African interior were brought by
                        native, Arab, and Portuguese traders before being shipped to Zanzibar. Zanzibar, under Omani
                        control by the mid-17th century, became a major hub for supplying slave labor to local
                        plantations and European colonies. The architectural heritage of Bagamoyo reflects its diverse
                        influences, including grand houses built by wealthy Arabs and Indian merchants and the distinct
                        styles introduced by German settlers in the 19th century. Today, the significance of Bagamoyo
                        and the Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route is recognized, with efforts underway to preserve its
                        historic buildings and raise public awareness about its past.</p>
