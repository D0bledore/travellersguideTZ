                    <h2>History of Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania has a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years. The region was home
                        to
                        some of the earliest human ancestors, as evidenced by fossil discoveries in Olduvai Gorge. In
                        the
                        late 19th century, the area was colonized by Germany, and later, after World War I, it became a
                        British mandate known as Tanganyika. Tanganyika gained independence in 1961, and in 1964, it
                        united
                        with the island of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
