                    <h2>Facts about Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse culture, rich history, and natural
                        beauty. The country gained independence from Britain in 1961. The capital city is Dodoma, while
                        Dar es Salaam remains the largest city and main economic hub. The official languages are Swahili
                        and English, and the currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).</p>
                    <p>Tanzania's vibrant and youthful population stands at 67,438,106 in 2023, experiencing a robust
                        annual growth rate of 2.96% and holding a significant global presence at 0.84%, ranking 22nd in
                        the world. The nation's vitality is reflected in its remarkably young median age of 17 years and
                        a high Total Fertility Rate of 4.6 live births per woman, symbolizing a society full of life and
                        potential. Life expectancy brings a mix of hope and challenge, with an average of 67.6 years,
                        where women live slightly longer at 69.8 years compared to 65.5 years for men. The
                        heart-wrenching infant mortality rate is 29.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the mortality
                        rate for children under five is 39.7 per 1,000, highlighting ongoing healthcare struggles.
                        Urbanization is steadily advancing, with 38% of the population living in cities, and Dar es
                        Salaam thrives as the bustling heart of Tanzania, home to 2,698,652 people.</p>

                    <p>Tanzania's economy has witnessed a remarkable journey, with its nominal GDP soaring to $75.71
                        billion USD in 2022. This impressive figure, reflecting the nation's resilience and growth,
                        tells a story of persistent progress. Adjusted for inflation, the real GDP of $67.10 billion USD
                        underscores a tangible improvement in the country's economic health, despite global challenges.

                        The 4.56% GDP growth rate in 2022, a testament to Tanzania's vibrant economic activities, adds
                        nearly $3 billion USD to the previous year's figure. This growth is not just a number; it
                        represents new opportunities, hopes, and dreams for millions of Tanzanians.

                        With a population of 65.5 million, growing at 3% annually, the nation is bustling with
                        potential. The GDP per capita, inching up to $1,025, signifies gradual progress in the average
                        Tanzanian's standard of living, though the journey towards widespread prosperity continues.

                        Reflecting on the past few decades, Tanzania's economic narrative is one of enduring ambition
                        and gradual success, moving from a modest $4.26 billion USD in 1993 to today's robust economy.
                        This growth speaks volumes about the nation's tenacity and the unyielding spirit of its people,
                        striving for a brighter, more prosperous future.</p>

                    <h2>History of Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania's history is deeply rooted in ancient human activity, highlighted by the discovery of
                        the Paranthropus boisei skull by Mary Leakey at Olduvai Gorge in 1959, dating back to between
                        2.3 and 1.2 million years ago. Before the 19th century, most historical records focus on the
                        coastal areas, although the interior holds significant prehistoric sites like Olduvai. The
                        coastal regions saw major waves of in-migration and trade from Greece, Rome, Phoenicia, Arabia,
                        Persia, and India starting as early as the 5th century BCE. These early trading interactions led
                        to the establishment of numerous Asian and Arab settlements along the coast and into the
                        interior, fostering relatively friendly relations between Arabs and African neighbors. The
                        arrival of the Portuguese in the late 15th century challenged Arab dominance, but their
                        influence waned by the early 18th century due to alliances between coastal Arabs and the ruler
                        of Muscat.</p>

                            paleoanthropological localities in the world; the many sites exposed by the gorge have
                            proven
                            invaluable in furthering understanding of early human evolution.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The late 18th century saw renewed interest in the region from the French, who revived the slave
                        trade from Kilwa, prompting the sultan of Muscat to appoint a new Omani governor there. This
                        period marked a significant increase in Arab trading activities, particularly in slaves and
                        ivory, with Arab traders penetrating deeper into the interior by the 19th century. Important
                        trading centers like Tabora and Ujiji emerged, though they faced resistance from African leaders
                        like Mirambo, who disrupted trade routes in the 1860s and '70s.</p>
                    <p>European interest in Tanganyika grew in the 19th century with missionaries such as Johann Ludwig
                        Krapf and Johannes Rebmann reaching Kilimanjaro in the late 1840s. Their reports stimulated
                        British explorers Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke to journey from Bagamoyo to Lake
                        Tanganyika in 1857-58, with Speke also exploring Lake Victoria. David Livingstone's expedition
                        in 1866 aimed to expose the slave trade's horrors and promote legitimate commerce, leading to
                        further explorations by H.M. Stanley and V.L. Cameron. These European explorations, driven by a
                        mix of geographic curiosity and humanitarian concerns, significantly influenced the region,
                        attracting more missionary societies and intertwining Tanzania's history with broader global
                        narratives.</p>

                    <p>Bagamoyo, a historic town in Tanzania, played a pivotal role in the East African slave trade
                        during the 18th and 19th centuries. The town's coral buildings, characteristic of Swahili
                        construction, served as a gathering point where slaves from the African interior were brought by
                        native, Arab, and Portuguese traders before being shipped to Zanzibar. Zanzibar, under Omani
                        control by the mid-17th century, became a major hub for supplying slave labor to local
                        plantations and European colonies. The architectural heritage of Bagamoyo reflects its diverse
                        influences, including grand houses built by wealthy Arabs and Indian merchants and the distinct
                        styles introduced by German settlers in the 19th century. Today, the significance of Bagamoyo
                        and the Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route is recognized, with efforts underway to preserve its
                        historic buildings and raise public awareness about its past.</p>

                    <h2>Culture</h2>
                    <p>The cultural landscape of Tanzania is defined by its diverse ethnic composition, with over 120
                        indigenous African groups including Bantu and Nilotic peoples. Swahili and English are official
                        languages, reflecting linguistic diversity. Religious practices include Islam, Christianity
                        (including various denominations), and traditional beliefs. Tanzania's culture is shaped by
                        historical influences like missionary activities and colonial education, impacting ethnic
                        representation and cultural practices. Efforts to preserve cultural heritage are evident through

                    <h2>Geography of Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tanzania is located in Eastern Africa, bordered by the Indian Ocean, between Kenya and
                        Mozambique. The country covers a total area of 947,300 sq km, which includes the islands of
                        Mafia, Pemba, and Zanzibar, making it slightly larger than twice the size of California. It has
                        land boundaries totaling 3,861 km with eight neighboring countries and a coastline of 1,424
                        km.<br>

                        Geographically, Tanzania features coastal plains, a central plateau, and highlands in the north
                        and south. The climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate in the highlands. The
                        country's elevation ranges from sea level at the Indian Ocean to Africa's highest point, Mount
                        Kilimanjaro, at 5,895 meters.<br>

                        Tanzania is rich in natural resources, including hydropower, tin, phosphates, iron ore, coal,
                        diamonds, gemstones, gold, natural gas, and nickel. Land use is predominantly non-arable, with
                        only 12.25% of land being arable and 1.79% used for permanent crops. The country has significant
                        renewable water resources and limited irrigated land.<br>

                        Environmental challenges include soil degradation, deforestation, desertification, and threats
                        to marine habitats and wildlife due to illegal hunting and trade. Tanzania is part of various
                        international environmental agreements and is notable for its natural landmarks, including
                        Kilimanjaro and three of Africa's largest lakes: Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake
                        Nyasa.<br>

                    <h2>Tourist Attractions in Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>Tanzania boasts a diverse cultural tapestry with over 120 ethnic groups, shaped by a history of
                        migrations and influences from Bantu settlers, Arabs, and European colonizers. Despite this
                        diversity, Tanzanians share a strong national identity, largely attributed to the widespread use
                        of Swahili alongside tribal languages. The Sukuma, Hadzabe, Maasai, Chagga, and others
                        contribute unique traditions—from hunting societies to pastoralism and agricultural communities.
                        This cultural richness, coupled with Tanzania's linguistic unity and stunning natural
                        landscapes, invites visitors to explore its vibrant heritage and modern amenities.</p>

                    <figcaption>Serengeti National Park, located in north-central Tanzania, is renowned for its vast
                        grasslands and significant wildlife populations. Established in 1951 and covering 5,700 square
                        miles (14,763 square km), it is a UNESCO World Heritage site celebrated for hosting the largest
                        remaining land animal migration on Earth. The park is home to millions of animals including
                        wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, and numerous predators like lions and cheetahs. Serengeti's
                        diverse ecosystem ranges from plains to woodland savannas, supporting over 350 bird species and
                        a variety of flora and fauna. Environmental challenges include human encroachment and poaching,
                        impacting the park's biodiversity and iconic species.
